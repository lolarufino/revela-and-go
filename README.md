# Revela & Go 📷

Personal project of a website where you can, given a filter, check in wich film photography lab you can develop your film. 

🔹 I made my own database of labs in Spain. 
🔹 Some routes are protected with a token. User must login or register to view them.
🔹 I designed it with Figma, used Vue as framework for the frontend and Vuex to apply the flux pattern.
🔹 Everything is tested using Jest.
🔹 I decided to use Typescript for frontend and Javascript for backend.

## Technologies used

⭐ Frontend: Vue | Vuex | Jest | SASS | BEM | Typescript

⭐ Backend: NodeJS | ExpressJS | MongoDB | Mongoose | PostMan | Passport | JWT | API Restful

⭐ Other: Figma
